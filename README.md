MiNET - .NET Standard
=====    

## What is this?
This is a custom fork of MiNET with modifications to my wishes.
This specific branch is a version of MiNET able to run on .NET Core / .NET Standard 2.0

## Does everything from the "1.2" branch work on here?
I have not properly tested this myself, encryption works tho :P
Plugins written in .NET Framework are not compatible with this branch.
