MiNET
=====
This is a custom fork of MiNET with modifications to my wishes.  
One of the noteable things would probably be mono support with encryption.  

## Does everything from the original MiNET Repository work on this fork?
Some plugins will, some plugins won't. As i said above, this is modified to my wishes.
